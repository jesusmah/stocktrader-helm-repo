# stocktrader-helm-repo

This GitHub repository is meant to be the IBM StockTrader Helm Repository which would contain each IBM StockTrader microservice Helm chart as well as a main IBM StockTrader Application umbrella chart to get the application installed all at once.

Therefore, you will find here in this repository, under the **docs/charts** folder, the various Helm charts (and several versions for some of them) that make up the IBM StockTrader Application.

For more information about the IBM StockTrader Application and how to install it, please visit the [IBM StockTrader Application GitHub repository](https://github.com/jesusmah/stocktrader-app/tree/v2).
